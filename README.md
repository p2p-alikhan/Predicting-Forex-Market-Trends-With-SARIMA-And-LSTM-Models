# Predicting Forex Market Trends With SARIMA And LSTM Models
-------------------------------

# Introduction:
In the fast-paced world of financial markets, accurately predicting trends is crucial for traders and analysts. The Forex market, known for its volatility and global reach, poses a unique challenge in forecasting price movements. This article explores two powerful forecasting models: SARIMA (Seasonal Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average) and LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory). These models are highly effective at identifying complex patterns in time-series data, making them valuable tools for predicting Forex market prices.

# Required tools:
pandas: Python library for data manipulation and analysis, providing data structures like DataFrame.

numpy: Fundamental package for scientific computing with support for large, multi-dimensional arrays and matrices.

matplotlib: Comprehensive library for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python.

seaborn: Data visualization library based on matplotlib, providing a high-level interface for drawing attractive and informative statistical graphics.

statsmodels: Python module for estimating statistical models and conducting statistical tests.

sklearn: Simple and efficient tools for data mining and data analysis, known for its machine learning algorithms.

tensorflow: An open-source platform developed by Google for building and deploying machine learning models.

keras: High-level neural networks API, capable of running on top of TensorFlow, Theano, or CNTK.

pmdarima: Python library for automatically selecting the optimal ARIMA model for time-series data.

yfinance: Python library to fetch historical market data from Yahoo Finance.
